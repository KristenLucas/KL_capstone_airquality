**Motivation**

### There are very few things that the entire world has in common, but breathing is surely one of them. When I was a kid living in southern Arizona, I remember going to larger cities and being shocked at the severity of the air quality that you could, so plainly, see! I wanted to see if my memory of that was accurate based on the data. 

**Overview**
### Below are a few of the questions that will be answered:
1. How is the Air Quality Index (AQI) determined?
1. How is the US doing vs other countries?
1. Which cities in the US have the best and worst average air quality?
1. Is there a particular month in which air quality is worse?
1. How does all of this relate to Nashville?

**Process - ETL**
### I had a lot of fun with this! I had to find the right data, clean the data in Excel, analyze in PostgreSQL, and visualize in PowerBI. I loved being able to use so many of the skills I learned during my NSS class. 

**What I Learned About Air Quality**
### There are large variances in air quality depending on where you live. It's not always just about car pollution either! In fact, the country that has the worst air quality in the world, and the reason, was very surprising to me! There are so many more things that I learned, but you'll have to take a look at my presentation to hear the rest.
